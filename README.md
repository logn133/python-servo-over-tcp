# Python Servo Control Over TCP
This script was made to listen for commands over the network to change the rotation of a servo motor. This script was originally made to turn on and off a light controlled by another host on the network running the Client-Side script.

# ToDO
- Upload the Client-Side version of the script
- Make the script universal (take out hard coded IPs and ports)
